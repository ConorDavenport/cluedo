# Cluedo solving program
The aim of this project is to develop a program that can solve a game of Cluedo. This project brief assumes the user knows the game and knows how to play the game. Rules to Cluedo are found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo#Rules. This program compiles sorts all of the cards, the suspects, rooms, and weapons into three sets for each player. The yes set contains cards that we know the player has, the no set contains cards that we know the player doesn't have, and the maybe set contains cards that the player might have.

## Motivation
This project was started after a humiliating loss in a game of Cluedo.

## Features
This program was originally written in C++ to figure out how the system should work. The C++ version has no user interaction and requires the game to be hard coded into it before compiling. The program was copied into JavaScript and embedded into the cluedo.html page to allow for user interaction.
