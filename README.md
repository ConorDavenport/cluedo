# cluedo solving program
The aim of this project is to develop a program that can solve a game of cluedo.

### C++
As of 28/07/19 you can't make any mistakes like spelling or capitalisation, or miscategorising when entering cards into the system.

Need to add in functionality that allows the program to look back on previous guesses and infer from them.
